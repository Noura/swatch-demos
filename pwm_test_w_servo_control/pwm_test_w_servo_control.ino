/*************************************************** 
  This is an example for our Adafruit 16-channel PWM & Servo driver
  PWM test - this will drive 16 PWMs in a 'wave'

  Pick one up today in the adafruit shop!

  These displays use I2C to communicate, 2 pins are required to  
  interface. For Arduino UNOs, thats SCL -> Analog 5, SDA -> Analog 4
